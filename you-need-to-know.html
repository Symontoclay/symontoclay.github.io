<p>
If you're thinking about getting started with SymOntoClay there are a few things you should know.
SymOntoClay lets you create game AI in a different way than you usual do.
As such, you should take time to inform yourself before using SymOntoClay for any serious projects.
</p>

<p>
I know that learning and using SymOntoClay by others is very unlikely yet.
But I must take steps to prevent misunderstandings.
</p>

<h2 data-href='plus_unknown_language' is-processed="true">

Plus another language, in addition unknown
<a href="https://symontoclay.github.io/you-need-to-know.html#plus_unknown_language" name="plus_unknown_language" title="The link to the section" class="permalink"><i class='fas fa-link'></i></a></h2>

<p>
SymOntoClay is only for creating game AI.
This means that all other parts of the game (animations, visual effects, scene management, etc.) will need to be done in the scripting language of your game engine.
</p>

<p>
For Unity this means that you have to write one part of the code in C# and the AI ​​code in SymOntoClay.
Create game with two different programming languages is not convenient.
</p>

<p>
Also SymOntoClay is unknown language.
You can not find developers who know this language.
</p>

<p>
I hope that in the future the benefits of using SymOntoClay will outweigh these obstacles.
But now that's far from the case.
</p>

<h2 data-href='lacks_features' is-processed="true">

SymOntoClay lacks features for game development
<a href="https://symontoclay.github.io/you-need-to-know.html#lacks_features" name="lacks_features" title="The link to the section" class="permalink"><i class='fas fa-link'></i></a></h2>

<p>
I'm focused on adding interesting features that will make SymOntoClay stand out from other languages.
But I don't have enough free time.
Therefore, many important, but not impressive, features are not added to the language for a long time.
</p>

<p>
As a result, SymOntoClay has many interesting features (like fuzzy logic or complex triggers), but lacks many of the features that even the simplest programming languages generally have.
</p>

<p>
SymOntoClay does not have a debugger.
</p>

<p>
Module (package) infrastructure and standard library in very rudimentary state.
</p>

<p>
<b>In general and frankly, I think that SymOntoClay is still too experimental and raw for practical use.</b>
</p>

<h2 data-href='unstable' is-processed="true">
<img src='https://symontoclay.github.io/icons8-warning-48.png' width='48px' height='48px' alt='Warning logo'>
SymOntoClay contains many bugs and is very unstable
<a href="https://symontoclay.github.io/you-need-to-know.html#unstable" name="unstable" title="The link to the section" class="permalink"><i class='fas fa-link'></i></a></h2>

<p>
I'm focused on adding interesting features that will make SymOntoClay stand out from other languages.
But I don't have enough free time.
Therefore, SymOntoClay contains many bugs and is very unstable.
</p>

<p>
Right now my main goals are:
    <ul>
	    <li>
		    to add more interesting features
		</li>
		
	    <li>
		    to make the simplest Zero player game in SymOntoClay
		</li>
	</ul>


<p>
Bugs are fixed only those that are direct obstacles to achieving these goals.
</p>

SymOntoClay is very slow and consumes a lot of computer resources
<a href="https://symontoclay.github.io/you-need-to-know.html#very_slow_and_consumes_a_lot" name="very_slow_and_consumes_a_lot" title="The link to the section" class="permalink"><i class='fas fa-link'></i></a></h2>

<p>
I think that to some extent, slowness of NPC code is normal.
This makes the NPC's reaction speed similar to the player's reaction speed.
</p>

<p>
But with more than 10 NPCs, they become too slow.
When the number of NPCs is more than 30, they generally stop react to anything.
</p>

<p>
My PC:<br>
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 4600H with Radeon Graphics, 3000 Mhz, 6 Core(s), 12 Logical Processor(s)<br>
RAM: 16.0 GB <br>
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking of ways to improve the performance of the engine and have planned to implement several ways.
But as I mentioned before, I'm focused on adding interesting features and don't have free time to optimization.
</p>

<p>
I am developing SymOntoClay in my free time.
Development is not too intense because SymOntoClay is a hobby and also I want to keep work-life balance.
