<h1 class='center-h'>SymOntoClay project</h1>

<p>
SymOntoClay is a hybrid language with logic programming and fuzzy logic for defining game characters behavior.
</p>

<p>
The project is planned as open source asset for Unity3D.
</p>

<h4 class='center-h'>Name meaning and pronunciation</h4>

<p>
It's abbreviation of &quot;<b>Sym</b>bolic <b>onto</b>logical <b>clay</b>&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Pronunciation: &lbrack;sim äntə klā&rbrack;.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Symbolic</dt>
	
    <dd>
	    I've been focusing on Symbolic artificial intelligence. 
        It will allow us to define <abbr title='Non-Player Character'>NPC</abbr> behavior in more determined way. 
        I think It's important for game plot and gameplay.
    </dd>
	
    <dt>Ontological</dt>
	
    <dd>
	I've been focusing on explicitly describing knowledge.
	</dd>
	
    <dt>Clay</dt>
	
    <dd>
	It's a reference to the clay from which God created Adam.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h2 class='center-h'>Aim</h2>

<p>
The main aim of the project is experimenting on using various symbolic artificial intelligence approaches in game developing.
First of all It's logic programming, fuzzy logic, fuzzy inheritance and natural language processing (NLP).
</p>

<p>
I think symbolic logic will help to do indie-game developing better.
There are many interesting things in symbolic artificial intelligence approaches.
And It is very interesting for me to use and see them in gaming.
</p>

<p>
It will be game <abbr title='Artificial Intelligence'>AI</abbr>, that is less strict, than AI for other areas.
</p>

<p>
Now SymOntoClay is focused on pure experimenting.
But in the future I hope to give a tool to indie game developers for creating games with more powerful AI then It's available them now.
I will be very glad If It helps to increase amount of cool games, happy users and game developers.
</p>

<h2 class='center-h'>Domain-specific language (DSL)</h2>

<p>
SymOntoClay has own Domain-specific language (DSL).
</p>

<p>
It helps using interesting AI features in more convenient way.
Some features are difficult to add for existing languages, for example, multiple fuzzy inheritance.
</p>

<p>
The language is also called SymOntoClay like the engine.
</p>

<p>
I'm completely free in my experiments with syntax.
</p>

<p>
My main criterion in SymOntoClay's syntax decisions is including interesting features into the syntax as gracefully as possible and making using them convenient in game development.
</p>

<h2 class='center-h'>Project status</h2>

<p>
I've making SymOntoClay alone in my free time since 2016. 
So It's not fast.
</p>

<p>
I've made two prototypes: first implementation of domain-specific language and integration with Unity3D.
I've posted the second prototype's demo-video into an Indie game developers group on Facebook. 
You can see this demo <i class="fab fa-facebook" title="Facebook"></i><a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/IndieGameDevs/permalink/10155707420791573/'>here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm focusing on key features (the interesting features from AI). 
Other features is being added only for support working or demonstrating the key features.
So there can be absent necessary for practical using  but non key features on the DSL or engine.
Also stability and performance are not in focus - I don't have time for these sides while key features have not been implemented.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to continue my experiments.
And I hope this project will become useful for many indie game developers in the future.
</p>

<p>
Feel free contact to me about the project. 
I will be glad to receive feedback.
